# Satellite Image Classification
In this project, we address the problem of classifying satellite images into different categories using deep learning techniques. The goal is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of classifying satellite images into four distinct categories: desert, green areas, water, and cloudy. This type of classification is crucial for applications in environmental monitoring, agriculture, natural resource management, and more.

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification/data). This dataset, named RSI-CB256, includes satellite images from various sensors and Google Map snapshots, categorized into four different classes. The creation and use of benchmark datasets like this are vital for developing and testing intelligent interpretation algorithms in the field of remote sensing (RS) image interpretation.
