# SVMs 

As a practical exercise in SVMs (Support Vector Machines), the task is to apply the concepts learned in class to a dataset that describes environmental characteristics of seven different types of terrain. The measurements were generated from a set of radars and sonars. The dataset is attached to this workshop, and the following activities are to be carried out:

- **Explore the dataset**: Perform a correlation analysis to identify possible variables with a high correlation index (above 95%).

- **Data preprocessing**: Eliminate highly correlated variables and scale the data.

- **Train an SVM with a polynomial kernel**: Train an SVM using the preprocessed dataset with a polynomial kernel.

- **Train an SVM with an RBF kernel**: Train an SVM using the preprocessed dataset with an RBF kernel.
