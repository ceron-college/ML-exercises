Clustering Workshop
As a practical exercise in clustering, it is proposed to apply the concepts learned in class to a dataset that collects information on the happiness index of countries around the world. The following activities should be carried out:

Explore the dataset and perform data exploration to find the characteristics that will allow you to carry out the clustering process more effectively.

Perform a clustering process using the k-means algorithm with the selected variables. You should conduct different tests with various combinations of variables.

With the final trained model, plot the countries on a map using a color code that represents the group they belong to, using the Plotly library (https://plotly.com/python/maps/).
