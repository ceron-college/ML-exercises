# Clustering

As a practical exercise in clustering, the task is to apply the concepts learned in class to a dataset that collects information on the happiness index of countries around the world. The following activities are to be carried out:

- **Explore the dataset**: Perform data exploration to identify the features that will allow you to carry out the clustering process more effectively.
  
- **Clustering process**: Conduct a clustering process using the k-means algorithm with the selected variables. You should perform different tests with various combinations of variables.

- **Visualization**: With the final trained model, plot the countries on a map using a color code to represent the group to which they belong, using the Plotly library ([https://plotly.com/python/maps/](https://plotly.com/python/maps/)).

**Note**: The dataset intended for this workshop is attached within the same clustering section.
