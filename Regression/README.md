# Regression Workshop

As a practical exercise in linear regression, the task is to apply the concepts learned in class to a dataset extracted from Kaggle, selected by the members of each team, in which the following activities are to be carried out:

- **Apply simple linear regression**: Perform a simple linear regression on the target variable using at least 3 independent variables separately.
  
- **Apply multiple linear regression**: Perform multiple linear regression on the target variable using at least 3 independent variables simultaneously.

- **Apply polynomial regression**: Perform polynomial regression on the target variable using at least 3 independent variables simultaneously.

- **Evaluate models**: Evaluate the models with the RÂ² coefficient.

- **Report**: Write a report with the results obtained.
