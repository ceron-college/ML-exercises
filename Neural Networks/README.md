# Neural Networks Workshop

As a practical exercise in neural networks, the task is to create a classification model to determine whether the individuals in a provided dataset suffer from heart disease. The dataset is attached to this workshop.

- **Dataset exploration and preprocessing**: Perform a brief exploration and preprocessing of the dataset.

- **Propose three different neural network architectures**: Design three distinct neural network architectures for the classification task.

- **Train the architectures**: Train the proposed architectures on the dataset.

- **Generate confusion matrices**: Create confusion matrices with accuracy and recall measures for each trained model and analyze the obtained results.
